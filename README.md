###Widening_EU_PROPOSALS

This directory contains the Work Programme of the EU 2023-2024 on widening the EU research area. It is a plan for future calls for joint projects. In particular the "Twinning" programme could be of interest for us. Funding for relatively small bottom-up projects with a mix of EU based sites and a site from a "new" area. The latter has to be the coordinator and gets 50% of the funding. Other partners have to share the other 50%. Part of the funding (30%) can be used for research, the rest for coordination activities such as workshops and the like.
