### Widening_EU_PROPOSALS

The directory "Widening_EU_PROPOSALS" contains the Work Programme of the EU 2023-2024 on widening the EU research area. It is a plan for future calls for joint projects. In particular the "Twinning" programme could be of interest to us. It provides funding for relatively small bottom-up projects with a mix of EU based sites and a site from a "widening" area (Georgia in our case). The latter has to take the role of the coordinator of the project and will get 50% of the funding. Other partners have to share the remaining 50%. Part of the funding (30%) can be used for research, the rest is for coordination activities such as workshops and the like.
